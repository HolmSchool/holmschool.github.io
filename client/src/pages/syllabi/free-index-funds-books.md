title: "Free Index Funds, Frugality, and Financial Independence Books"
subject: "Personal Finance"
---


Free books and videos (maybe long-form blogs) on index funds/index investing and financial independence / early retirement (FIRE). Also check out your public library's physical stack as well as their Overdrive/Libby e-subscription. Contributions welcome. Also some public libraries have Kanopy subscriptions, and there are a number of good Teaching Company lectures on investing, finance, and the stock market.

If all copies of the book you want to read are checked out on Archive.org, be sure to search for it anyway on Archive because they are always adding new scans and it's hard to keep an up-to-date catalog of every scan.
