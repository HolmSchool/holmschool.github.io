Catalog of free books and resources about mental illness

#### Contribution note: Please no [psychoanalysis books](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/articles/199601/carl-sagan) nor anti-psychiatry/anti-medication/pomo books. Keep it in line with NAMI's  advocacy. Will try and moderate to the best of my abilities.
