Compendium of free online SAT and ACT test prep

Don't overdo it, but don't sit it out completely either. Nothing's wrong with studying vocabulary (it's what writer do) or mathematics (it's what scientists do), and we here at Holm Schol are aiming at becoming competent writers and scientists. Obviously you can't make up for lost time if you didn't grow up reading books in your free time, but it's never too late to start a hobby of reading. You can score a full ride scholarship if you do well on the PSAT (national merit scholarship) or SAT/ACT, so it's worth it to study for them (and it can cost you zero dollars if you do it on your computer or through your public library).
