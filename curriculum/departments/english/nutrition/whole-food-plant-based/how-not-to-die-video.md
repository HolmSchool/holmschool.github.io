Dr. Michael Greger is a nutritionist who has spent much of his life creating open source diet and nutrition content (including books, videos, and podcasts). The creations of this philanthropy (notably https://NutritionFacts.org) provides free insights into the role eating animal-based foods causes modern diseases. With the publication of his book, __How Not to Die__ (2015), Dr. Greger compiled the most important facts from his traveling talks of the previous four years into an hour long presentation about animal foods and disease. As many people think eating vegan will cause harm to them, it is important for doctors and scientists to address this fear by properly assuring that eating 100% WFPB diets will cause no vitamin or nutrient deficiency (though you should always take your B12 supplement and D (during winter) if you are vegan).

Like Forks Over Knives, Dr. Greger takes a medical-centered approach to explaining how WFPB diet literacy can directly cure many health problems.
