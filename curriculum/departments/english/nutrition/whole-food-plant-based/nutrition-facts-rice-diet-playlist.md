# --description--

Dr. Michael Greger's NutritionFacts.org has compiled a playlist of videos concern Dr. Walter Kempner's Rice Diet. The point of exploring this topic is to learn that even highly restricted whole food, plant-based diets (as in this one of rice and fruit and a multivitamin) result in no nutrient deficiency even over potentially long durations of compliance. That such a restricted diet results in drastic improvements of people suffering from extreme sickness should give insight to the healthfulness of (less restricted) WFPB vegan diets.

Note: As mentioned in this video, do not try this diet without medical supervision due to extreme risk of electrolyte imbalance.
