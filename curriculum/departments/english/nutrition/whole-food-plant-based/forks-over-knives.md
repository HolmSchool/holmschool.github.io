__Forks Over Knives__ (2011) is a film that investigates how animal product consumption is the cause of many chronic diseases. An explanation of why animal product foods hurts our endothelial cells, resulting in artherosclerosis, implores the viewer to go "whole food plant based", a term that means a diet of starches, fruit, and vegetables. WFPB diets are free of cholesterol, allowing the veins and arteries to heal from the plaques that form from consuming cholesterol in the form of animal-based foods. The low fat nature of WFPB diets also helps with Type II diabetes, as diabetes is caused by excess fat in the cells. This is a good introduction to some of the dieticians in the WFPB space, and an introduction to veganism that does not rely on animal rights (though that is important too). The proof (in the soy pudding, so to speak) is that a plant-based diet is not harmful or lacking in any shape. In fact it is the inclusion of animal products that is causing harm to homo sapiens (a herbivorous species). When a herbivore eats animal products, sickness and illness is the result. No harm is caused by eating 100% plant-based, and consistent whole food consumption actually heals many chronic illnesses.
