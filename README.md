### Why You Shouldn't Spend a Cent on Learning How to Program

#### Why is technology on Moore's Law but the cost of college rises many times faster than inflation? Because private university is a scam.

A computer science professor teaches a 4-course load each semester for $100,000 a year salary. A simple breakdown means a single class costs $13,000 to make. If that class is recorded and put on YouTube, 50 million people can watch the video. $13,000 / 50,000,000 = 0.00026. That means each viewing of the video costs the Professor 0.03% of a cent. This fee is easily covered by ad revenue for each viewing on YouTube. That is to say, by watching an ad before each class's video, you are paying the professor for the cost of producing that class. What used to cost hundreds of dollars (per class) in brick and mortar university now costs 0.03% of a cent. That is an example of how higher education is on Moore's Law, in which computer advances mean logarithmic changes to pricing.  Computer Science college is now free, distributed amongst millions of online learners instead of amongst just a couple dozen students in a brick and mortar classroom. The lessons are the same, the materials and class content are the same, the only difference is instead of paying thousands of dollars per class you are watching an ad for five seconds before each lecture. There is no going back from this reality. Computer science education is now free by the very existence of the internet that computer science education created. If you pay for expensive college given this reality (especially with the mandatorily non-bankruptable student loans), you are squandering away money that could rather compound in your interest for 40+ years if invested in total stock market index funds while still college-aged. The redistribution of wealth, from your own net worth to the college's own net worth, is one of the reasons my generation faces having millions of dollars removed from our net worth. The next generation of students doesn't have to make that choice anymore, though. They can study online through free open source or affordable digital educational resources.

Since many computer scientists contribute to open source, there are many computer scientists who also use open source licenses on the textbooks they write. Because open source is so prominent in computer science, it is foolish to pay money at this point to learn how to program when there is such a ubiquity of free self-guided tutorials. People are literally pouring out free computer science educational resources at an staggering rate because they love to volunteer their time towards CS education. To ignore these resources would come at a great opportunity cost to you, because student loans at a young age actually cost 64 times the sticker price in lost retirement savings/net worth. Holm School teaches CS students in Topeka, KS to be frugal in regards to their education and exploit all the free resources Topeka has to offer before spending any money on learning to program. The rewards are immense: Maxing out your 401k and IRA on index funds can be a means of attaining financial independence in just your thirties.

The graph above shows how many times the principal (i.e. paying tuition) is at a certain age when retiring at 65 versus investing that money in index funds. As you can see, your college actually costs you more than 100x the sticker cost when you're not allowed to invest the money you earn at your first job at 22 because you're paying your student loans, instead of investing your salary in index funds. A $60,000 student loan would mean losing out on $6,000,000 from your retirement versus if you had invested that $60,000 at age 22. Obviously, keeping your college costs as low as possible so you don't have student debt is worth more than any diploma, professional development, graduate degree, or advanced certification. The formula is f(age) = 2^((65-age)/(72/11.3)) (using the Rule of 72).

College is really expensive, but your public library and online open source education is free. There is no sacrifice to choosing the open source model. The textbooks and learning resources are just as good. You will still have to study computer science for four years and dedicate yourself to lot of hard work and long study hours everyday. You will have to learn just as much as the people who are spending money on their education; learning for free doesn't mean you can avoiding learning the same subjects that people spend tuition money to learn. The Holm School curriculum is not a fast track to a programming job, it's goal is to mimic a four year computer science college curriculum. I realize that may turn people away, but the goal is to develop competent programmers that prove free open source education is just as opportunity-rich as traditional brick and mortar universities. If you feel certain aspects are missing, you can use [other free computer science curricula](https://holmschool.github.io/computer-science#further-studies) to build your own classes. The point is, the sooner you integrate your computer science life into the world of open source (a good starting place is purchasing a Raspberry Pi and learning Debian), the more successful your computer science career will be. However, I don't think open source involvement should only be limited to source code. I also feel the sooner your integrate your educational life into the world of open source, the more successful your computer science career will be too. Most people don't go "that far", in fact promoting minimizing one's involvement with non-free university classes is a bit taboo in the United States where university is viewed as the great equalizer in society. But just read a few books about the student debt crisis and you'll discover that taking on debt at a young age is anathema to financial freedom, it permanently damages your net worth. Considering how robust the open source computer science educational community is, I think it seriously minimizes risk to pursue free education with OER. Many people disagree, but I hope to show you through this website that "Educating Yourself" is a great way to find success in computer science. The notion that the only way you'll be a successful computer scientist is by going to an expensive private university is more likely to wind you in the same place professionally, but with the financial hangover of hundreds of thousands of dollars of debt at age 22 instead of zero debt. When your salary goes to paying down a university loan instead of your 401k and IRA, where 38+ years of compounding rewards youthful frugality quite impressively, you are making an explicit trade off between prestige (a degree) and financial freedom (a maxed out 401k and IRA every year starting at age 22). In just my small time as a computer scientist, I find my explorations of frugality via open source education as enabled by the Topeka Public Library to be immensely rewarding. So I create Holm School to share my research. I wrote my undergraduate art history senior thesis at Reed College on the sociology of higher education, and as I have pursued that line of research even after graduating and moving on to a computer science career, and all indicators point to combining Mr. Money Mustache-level frugality with using public libraries and OER/OCW as educational springboard to be a great strategy for building a great computer science career. I am confident enough in this theory to share it publicly through Holm School to anyone willing to listen. Holm School is about educating yourself enough to be able to educate yourself. It is possible now to get a university education for free through open source resources on the internet. That wasn't true in the past, but it is now.
