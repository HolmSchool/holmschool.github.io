That means I want 1.5 * 38 = 57% Total Stock Market and 43% Small Cap Value.</p>\n<p>Therefore I would want to allocate to capture diversification:</p>\n<p><strong>Total Stock Market</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>TSM US - $VTI -  <code>.57 * .50 = .285</code> = 28.5% into $VTI</li>\n<li>TSM International Developed - $VXUS - <code>.57 * .375 = .21375</code> = 21.38% into $VXUS</li>\n<li>TSM Emerging Markets - $VWO - <code>.57 * .125 = 0.07125</code> = 7.13% into $VWO</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Small Cap Value</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>SCV US - $AVUV - <code>.43 * .50 = 0.215</code> = 21.5% into $AVUV</li>\n<li>SCV International Developed - $AVDV - <code>.43 * .375 = 0.16125</code> = 16.13% into $AVDV</li>\n<li>Value Emerging Markets - $AVEM - <code>.43 * .125 = 0.05375</code> = 5.38% into $AVEM</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Do this calculation for all 6 combinations and allocate your portfolio accordingly. Rebalance once a year according to your new age, or else buy and hold for life and just buy according to your age weights.</p>\n</section>","instructions":null,"ghissue":551,"triggerWarning":null}}},"pageContext":{"department":"personal-finance","name":"Small Cap Value ETFs","course":"personal-finance-and-index-investing","slug":"/learn/personal-finance/personal-finance-and-index-investing/scv","nextSlug":"/learn/personal-finance/personal-finance-and-index-investing/week-6-first-Jobs","nextName":"Week 6 - First Jobs","prevSlug":"/learn/personal-finance/personal-finance-and-index-investing/bernstein-pillars","prevName":"William Bernstein - The Four Pillars of Investing"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3159585216"],"slicesMap":{}}
