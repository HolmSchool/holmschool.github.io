An explanation of why animal product foods hurts our endothelial cells, resulting in artherosclerosis, implores the viewer to go \"whole food plant based\", a term that means a diet of starches, fruit, and vegetables. WFPB diets are free of cholesterol, allowing the veins and arteries to heal from the plaques that form from consuming cholesterol in the form of animal-based foods. The low fat nature of WFPB diets also helps with Type II diabetes, as diabetes is caused by excess fat in the cells. This is a good introduction to some of the dieticians in the WFPB space, and an introduction to veganism that does not rely on animal rights (though that is important too). The proof (in the soy pudding, so to speak) is that a plant-based diet is not harmful or lacking in any shape. In fact it is the inclusion of animal products that is causing harm to homo sapiens (a herbivorous species). When a herbivore eats animal products, sickness and illness is the result. No harm is caused by eating 100% plant-based, and consistent whole food consumption actually heals many chronic illnesses.</p>\n</section>","instructions":"<section id=\"instructions\">\n<p>Watch <strong>Forks over Knives</strong> on the official FOK website for free (requires an email address).</p>\n</section>","ghissue":4,"triggerWarning":null}}},"pageContext":{"department":"nutrition","name":"Forks Over Knives","course":"whole-food-plant-based","slug":"/learn/nutrition/whole-food-plant-based/forks-over-knives","nextSlug":"/learn/nutrition/whole-food-plant-based/how-not-to-die-video","nextName":"Dr. Michael Greger - HOW NOT TO DIE - The Role of Diet in Preventing, Arresting, & Reversing Our Top 15 Killers","prevSlug":"/learn/nutrition/whole-food-plant-based/life-in-balance","prevName":"A Life in Balance - Delicious, Plant-based Recipes for Optimal Health"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3159585216"],"slicesMap":{}}
