The creations of this philanthropy (notably https://NutritionFacts.org) provides free insights into the role eating animal-based foods causes modern diseases. With the publication of his book, <strong>How Not to Die</strong> (2015), Dr. Greger compiled the most important facts from his traveling talks of the previous four years into an hour long presentation about animal foods and disease. As many people think eating vegan will cause harm to them, it is important for doctors and scientists to address this fear by properly assuring that eating 100% WFPB diets will cause no vitamin or nutrient deficiency (though you should always take your B12 supplement and D (during winter) if you are vegan).</p>\n<p>Like Forks Over Knives, Dr. Greger takes a medical-centered approach to explaining how WFPB diet literacy can directly cure many health problems.</p>\n<p>The four previous talks that are collated into this talk can be viewed free at NutritionFacts.org:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://nutritionfacts.org/video/uprooting-the-leading-causes-of-death/\">Uprooting the Leading Causes of Death</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://nutritionfacts.org/video/more-than-an-apple-a-day-preventing-our-most-common-diseases/\">More Than an Apple a Day</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://nutritionfacts.org/video/from-table-to-able\">From Table to Able</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://nutritionfacts.org/video/food-as-medicine\">Food as Medicine</a></li>\n</ul>\n</section>","instructions":"<section id=\"instructions\">\n<p>Watch <strong>How Not To Die</strong> (the lecture) on YouTube.</p>\n</section>","ghissue":5,"triggerWarning":null}}},"pageContext":{"department":"nutrition","name":"Dr. Michael Greger - HOW NOT TO DIE - The Role of Diet in Preventing, Arresting, & Reversing Our Top 15 Killers","course":"whole-food-plant-based","slug":"/learn/nutrition/whole-food-plant-based/how-not-to-die-video","nextSlug":"/learn/nutrition/whole-food-plant-based/how-not-to-die-e-reserve","nextName":"Dr. Michael Greger - How Not to Die","prevSlug":"/learn/nutrition/whole-food-plant-based/forks-over-knives","prevName":"Forks Over Knives"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3159585216"],"slicesMap":{}}
