Much like Free/Libre Open Source Software (FLOSS) was developed around open licenses like GNU Public License with its \"copyleft\" approach, OER hopes to similarly use open licenses for artworks (such as Creative Commons CC-BY-SA) to develop a robust global online culture promoting free books. OER is now incrementally taking over the Do-It-Yourself digital publishing world, with hundreds of new OER textbooks being written and digitally published each year by academics, forever available to share openly in the public domain.</p>\n<p>The eight \"R's\" of OER are the rights to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Retain</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Make and own copies of the work (e.g., download, duplicate, store, and manage)</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Reuse</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Use the work in a wide range of ways (e.g., in a class, in a study group, on a website, in a video)</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Revise</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Adapt, modify and translate the work (e.g., translate the content into another language)</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Remix</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Combine it with another resource to make a new work (e.g., incorporate the content into a mashup)</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Redistribute</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Share the work with others (e.g., give a copy of the content to a friend)</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Redistributive Justice</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Equity: This aspect of social inclusion is concerned with issues of access to and affordability of learning materials, especially to learners who may otherwise be excluded due to lack of financial or technological means. Social justice as access. (Hollich 4)</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Recognitive Justice</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Diversity: This aspect ensures that the learning materials and resources we use are truly reflective of and inclusive of folks from marginalized communities.  Social jusice as participation. (Hollich 4)</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Representational Justice</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Inclusion: This is social justice as true inclusion and is the logical next step in the process of openly creating and sharing educational resources. Not only is it important for learners to be represented in their educational materials, but it is important the those groups are allowed to speak for and represent themselves, especially when those groups are, like those listed above, ones that are typically and historically marginalized by society. (Hollich 4)</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Accessibility</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>A11y ensures anyone, regardless of ability, is able to participate in some form in the learning experience. This means a text or webpage is screenreader friendly, images have ALT text descriptions, video is captioned, braille readers can interpret texts, and all aspects of modern a11y web-design are implemented. This even includes the site of learning such as the classroom being wheelchair friendly, accessible through public transportation, etc. There is no \"open\" to OER if it excludes entire classes of people.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>These rights, or permissions, are made possible through open licensing. For example, Creative Commons open licences help creators of OER retain copyright while allowing others to reproduce, distribute, and make some uses of their work, while FLOSS licenses (like CC ND) allow creators to release their work for free while still retaining important context assured by no-derivatives.</p>\n<p>OER is bringing down the cost of an academic degree and self-study, as well as providing rich, free source material for lifelong learners and library patrons. Whatever your aim, you can probably find an OER to your liking, for free and immediate unrestricted access. Dive in! Get acquainted with OER! And study college material all you want for free! Then create your own OER from your own specific cultural context and share how you'd like!</p>\n<p>EMBED: <a href=\"https://vimeo.com/13590841\">https://vimeo.com/13590841</a></p>\n<p>EMBED: <a href=\"https://youtu.be/dTNnxPcY49Q\">https://youtu.be/dTNnxPcY49Q</a></p>\n<p>OER at Washburn University's Mabee Library: <a href=\"https://libguides.washburn.edu/Open\">https://libguides.washburn.edu/Open</a></p>\n<h1>OER Repositories</h1>\n<p><a href=\"https://oasis.geneseo.edu/index.php\">OASIS</a> - (Openly Available Sources Integrated Search) - Open-content search discovery tool from 95 different sources and over 367,883 records.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://merlot.org\">MERLOT</a> - Provides access to curated online learning and support materials and content creation tools, led by an international community of educators, learners and researchers.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://oercommons.org\">OER Commons</a> - OER Commons is a public digital library of open educational resources.
