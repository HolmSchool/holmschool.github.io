<h1>Guide to Being a Not-Rich Computer Scientist</h1>
<p>For more information regarding Open Educational Resources and what they are, please read the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_educational_resources">wikipedia page</a> or read the free epub <a href="https://unglue.it/work/208269/">"Open: The Philosophy and Practices that are Revolutionizing Education and Science"</a></p>
<h2>I. Introduction</h2>
<p>Being a computer scientist is not the panacea most STEM proponents proclaim it to be. Supposedly you can become a millionaire by programming a novel app, there are zero boundaries to getting your foot in the door (it's a total meritocracy!), it's the highest-paid profession out of college, and so forth. This all sounds good for all the privileged students who have zero problems with enrolling at elite colleges for four years. But not everyone can afford college. It's tens of thousands of dollars, it requires food and housing in the most expensive cities in the country, the social scene is based around wasting parents' money each and every weekend, it requires moving out of your parents' house when you don't yet even have an income, etc. For some careers, college is simply a requirement. Biologists, chemists, and physicists need the labs, liberal arts researchers need the libraries and journals collections, people interested in becoming professors need a PhD, and so on.</p>
<p>But computer science doesn't need the academic infrastructure to teach what needs to be learned. The basic requirements are a computer (you don't even necessarily need a laptop) and the internet. There aren't socratic seminars and philosophical discussions surrounding your most recent readings. Classes are simply lectures, sometimes Powerpoints if you're unlucky. The problem sets don't require a lab, they are doable on your personal laptop and don't require equipment you don't personally own. Nothing in the computer science curriculum requires academic infrastructure. As long as you have a computer and the internet, you are able to complete college-level computer science work. It is not worth spending four years at college to realize that everything you did at a private library and private campus you could have done from your room at your parent's house for free. Take my word: there is nothing that is required for learning computer science that can't be accomplished for mere hundreds of dollars a year in your childhood room at your parents place as long as you have a computer and the internet, instead of spending tens of thousands of dollars a year at a university.</p>
<p>Becoming a computer scientist is a long process. I have been coding since I was 11 years old and making web pages since I was 12. If you don't have that type of experience, your learning curve will be more pronounced and you're going to have to spend a lot of time in the weeds getting your bearings straight. That's why you should totally save your money and not go to college to study computer science, except if you do have the funds. It is such a long process that saving your money by living at home and using inexpensive equipment and free internet resources provides you time to study the vast array of information that is required to know to be a programmer longer. If you spend four years in college, the debt will require that you immediately get a job. If you study online, then you can spend extra time learning entirely new fields like AI programming or web programming that you otherwise don't learn in standard computer science academic curricula. The general gist is that you have to spend 10 hours a day reading a book for months on end to learn a single topic at just an introductory level. The most sustainable way to do this is obviously the most inexpensive, as expensive is unsustainable. Don't get caught up in the belief you have to have a degree to learn what needs to be learned. By reading the (same) textbooks at home and doing the (same) programming exercises at home, you'll learn the material and not come out burdened by debt that pays for needless things like sports teams, lawn manicure, janitorial services, and food services. Education can happen on a shoestrings budget, especially in the day and age of open source and the internet, and university is an option that preys on people without community by threatening a life of failure if you don't pay the ransom of tens of thousands of dollars for a certification. Computer science is a bad ass profession. It is solving many real world problems and is improving life around the globe. But I am relentlessly pro-science. You don't need a university degree or independent wealth to contribute to these solutions. Save your money learning what you need at your parents house for four years instead of spending tens of thousands of dollars at university, then get out there, get a job in a city, and start making amazing new technologies debt-free!</p>
<p>I guess I should use this introduction to explain why I feel computer science isn't a topic that requires attending college. That doesn't mean that I think you can get a programming job out of high school (unless you studied programming all your childhood) if you don't already know how to code, or that there's no work involved. It just means that the time invested in learning computer science is better served at home using your personal computer than it is using the resources and buildings offered by a college. All you really need to learn CS resource-wise is a computer and the internet and plenty of free time. It just so happens that you're more bound to have free time if you aren't going deeply into debt during your study time. Personally I think the government should pay you to study CS, it improves people's lives around the world so much, so I think there is no economic argument for going into debt to study something that is bound to not only get you a job but also pay for your "profitless" study time in due course. Given that you can get a raspberry pi for $50 and internet for $45 a month, which is sufficient to sustain an independent study of an entire undergraduate computer science curriculum (4 years), I'm suggesting there's absolutely no need to pay for expensive college infrastructure. Being a humanities major requires college because your job future is teaching other people in a classroom the humanities with you as the lecturer (and classrooms require a college infrastructure). Computer Science jobs provide you with a laptop to do your work in a minimally-infrastructure-requiring role. They don't require infrastructure at the job site, so neither does learning how to do that job. I have worked remotely from home for a year now at my present job. I haven't been to the office for 9 months. You can't teach a humanities seminar at a coffee shop, but you can do your programming job at a coffee shop. A public library is sufficient infrastructure for a undergraduate CS student. A <em>bedroom</em> is sufficient infrastructure for a CS student. Mixing in college infrastructure is simply a luxury, in the same sort of way that being a member of a country club is a luxury. It doesn't provide anything that is necessary for life or employment, but it's a nice hangout if you have the money to pay for the buildings and golf courses and pools, and their concomitant upkeep. Well, some of us don't have enough money to pay for it. We're "not-rich." And college is bloated and they recklessly spends what money we give them, so it is constantly asking for more money and threatening to kick you out of the country club if you don't pay more and more each month. It used to be useful for finding employment, but now that formerly exclusive benefit is found via the internet too, and so it can no longer be justified in its cost given that the internet is $540 a year and a Raspberry Pi is $50.</p>
<p>I'm not arguing for the elimination of country clubs. I agree with Steven Pinker in Enlightenment Now (2018) that wealth is not a zero-sum game and that income inequality isn't an injustice. If I were rich, I'd have a country club membership too, I guess. But the idea that country club memberships should be <strong>mandatory</strong> for everyone in the nation, regardless of financial stability, is dumb and impractical and risky. Country clubs should turn down membership requests from people that can't afford the monthly bill. And colleges should do the same. Going into debt just to learn what can be learned on the internet is a foolish endeavor for not-rich people. Colleges seem great because they offer a place for a lot of rich, smart people to congregate and socialize. But that is also true of the workforce. You can get a lot of that great conversation and interaction with smart people at a good job. That's why you should spend your time now, while you're unemployed, studying computer science as many hours as you can fit in a day, so that you can get that great job that replaces the social function of college. Become OER literate to teach yourself how to teach yourself for free and earn what you deserve.</p>
<p>Fortunately a lot of smart (and wealthy enough) people have noticed requiring bricks-and-mortar college for a job as a computer science is needlessly restricting and curtails innovation, and have worked at making a college education available through the only medium that is scalable and cheap enough to deliver education for free: the internet. This is accomplished through open source licensing with a healthy dose of philanthropy and good will. But they have succeeded: There is zero need to attend college and pay ransom-level amounts of tuition just to learn computer science. Computer Science can be learned a hundred times over for free through open source educational resources. This was not always true, and colleges are hoping very dearly that young people don't catch on to this novel situation to protect their bottom line. But to those of us who can and do study the sociology of education and follow open source projects, the evidence is written on the wall: College is damagingly expensive compared to online learning (which costs a mere couple hundred dollars a year at most). In a year when computer science jobs went remote due to COVID, it should be obvious that if you can accomplish all your job tasks remotely in your home using just a laptop and a second monitor, you can also educate yourself in all aspects of computer science using just your laptop and a second monitor. It's almost a tautology: bricks and mortar colleges just ain't necessary for the subject of computer science. But think about it: doesn't that actually make the MOST sense of anything in the world? Of course COMPUTER SCIENCE is the one subject that doesn't require a university. The whole POINT of computer science is to bring education (and jobs, shopping, art, etc.) into the home, if you think about it.</p>
<h2>II. Books</h2>
<h3>OER</h3>
<p>You can go down the super hardcore path of learning computer science only through OER (Open Educational Resources). These are books that are available for free online. Dedicated groups are trying to improve OER books. One of the hardest parts is indexing all the OER books so they don't just get lost in the vortex of the internet, but Github has proven a semi-successful model (see: <a href="https://github.com/EbookFoundation/free-programming-books">EbookFoundation/free-programming-books</a>). The more main stream OER usually focuses on introductory material (see: <a href="https://www.openstax.org">OpenStax.org</a>), but there are certainly OER textbooks on more advanced/upper-undergrad topics. I really do appreciate all the authors that have open sourced their books. They are brilliant people. People who create educational content and give it away on the internet are heroes. University of the People uses <a href="http://saylor.org">Saylor's</a> OER for a majority of their computer science curriculum, so if you are using OER  as your primary sources (not a bad decision!) you might as well just get a computer science degree from UoPeople if you can afford it.</p>
<p>The best compendium of all the free OER programming books available on the internet is located at:   []EbookFoundation/free-programming-books](<a href="https://github.com/EbookFoundation/free-programming-books/blob/master/free-programming-books.md">https://github.com/EbookFoundation/free-programming-books/blob/master/free-programming-books.md</a>).  Find a modern programming language and dive in! There's no need to pay for introductory books to a programming language. Learning how to read computer science books is an essential task for any successful programmer. Might as well begin with a completely free text just to test the waters! And you can even do a deep dive with OER and still never spend a cent!</p>
<p>Another good website is <a href="http://FreeComputerBooks.com">FreeComputerBooks.com</a></p>
<p>One of the difficulties of OER is determining which texts are introductory and which texts are advanced.That's the purpose behind <a href="https://holmschool.github.io/computer-science">Holm School's Computer Science curriculum</a>, which organizes OER into a comprehensive but step-by-step computer science curriculum.</p>
<h3>Public Library</h3>
<p>The next sentence is only applicable to people living in bigger cities that have a nice public library, so your mileage may vary. Use your public library's computer science and programming books as much as humanly possible! After you complete some introductory programming courses on the internet (possibly through YouTube), then just go to your public library and check out those fat books on the various programming languages. Those fat books are enough to get you started on a programming language. Public libraries are really good about buying programming language books. Many of them are outdated, being that it's the public library after all, but if you consult YouTube for a video tutorial on how to set up a modern IDE and compiler for the given language, those old textbooks are gold for teaching you programming languages for free. I got started earning my computer science degree just by going to the Topeka public library a month before classes started and coding along with a decade old C++ book. Public libraries don't usually stock "computer science" books, i.e. the more academic side of things beyond "programming," but if you are trying to increase the number of programming languages you know, those fat language books are a great resource. There is no need to buy any of those sorts of books if you have a good public library (and they are EXPENSIVE). The computer books start at Dewey Decimal Number 0-100.</p>
<p>If you need a textbook or book that isn't available at your public library, they might offer an Interlibrary Loan system with other libraries in your state. Just because a book isn't available at your local library does not mean it is not available for you if you are willing to wait a week or two for transit time.</p>
<h3>Local College Library</h3>
<p>The local college in my hometown offers a borrower's card for anyone living in the city. In other words, I have the same access to books as any of the paying students. Granted, I can't access the wifi or computers, but with a cellphone one can have their own local hotspot. Maybe you can score a WiFi account if you email the college's IT department or librarian and explain that you're a townie that wants to do independent studying and you're indigent? Who knows, wilder things have happened.</p>
<h3>Perlego</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.perlego.com">Perlego</a> is a "Spotify for Textbooks," that is a subscription service where you can read college textbooks on your computer or tablet. It is relatively affordable at $12 a month. They just recently (in Spring 2020) opened up shop to the United States. Perlego is very interesting because they're basically a market for "unsuccessful" textbooks. That might sound unattractive, but think about it critically for a moment. Just like everything, textbook success is based on the power law: 20% of textbooks capture 80% of the market, and 20% of the 20% captures 80% of the 80%, and so on and so on recursively. This is a result of competition for attention being the organizing principal behind textbook sales, so the Pareto Principle will apply. But "failed" textbooks didn't fail because of lack of erudition or veracity or educational content, they failed simply because the stakes are against anyone competing for attention from the dominant textbook authors. Textbooks aren't $150 because they're $150 better than OER, they're $150 because they're famous for being famous (-ly expensive). People think price reflect quality. That is not the case with textbooks. Cheap textbooks, whether found on Perlego or else in the OER virtual stacks, are very good. Many great authors "fall through the cracks" in the power law popularity contest. While those authors won't rake in the dollars, you can use the power law to your advantage by focusing on the 80% of textbooks that only capture 20% of the market. Their lack of demand results in a reduce price, which you can access through an affordable Perlego subscription.</p>
<p>Textbooks, and by fiat university libraries, WILL go completely digital in time (surprisingly faster than you might expect). A paperless library, both university and public, is inevitable. While universities are encumbered by publisher contracts and journal subscriptions, Perlego cuts that fat and offers affordable digital textbooks in such a range of subjects as to mimic a university library. For the online learner, it is a boon to your bottomline. OER is expansive enough to cover a complete CS curriculum, but it is limited to the CS curriculum. Perlego fills in the gaps to offer a university curriculum/library stack in nearly EVERY university subject. This is very rewarding and affordable EdTech, I would actually prioritize this service before any other subscription-based educational service listed.</p>
<p>For example, you can read <a href="https://www.perlego.com/book/811725/introduction-to-java-programming-and-data-structures-comprehensive-version-global-edition-pdf">Liang's Java Programming textbook</a> in certain regions. This is the textbook that my school was attempting to get me to pay $150 for (I bought the previous edition for $15 used on Amazon). This demonstrates how important Perlego will be to self-educators in the future. $12 a month is chump change, anyone can work 2 hours at minimum wage per month to pay for thousands of computer science textbooks. While Holm School documents many free OER textbooks, you shouldn't completely write off paying $12 a month for Perlego just because it costs some money. Find a means of earning the money if you can. If you can pay, you'll find yourself with years of learning material to fuel a DIY computer science education. Considering how valuable books like Liang's Java Programming textbook are, and they are available on Perlego, I think it is important to subscribe to Perlego if you don't have access to a university library. It is inevitable that university libraries get digitized into an affordable subscription model that can be subscribed to by universities and independent learners alike. I am pleased to say it appears that time is finally here in the United States.</p>
<h3>Archive.org</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.archive.org">Archive.org</a> is a book archiving/digitizing non-profit. Old computer science textbooks are available for checkout for free. It is essentially a free digital public library. Why there is not a Federal digital public library I am not sure (perhaps paying for the writing and distributing of OER)! But Archive.org comes close. If you desperately cannot find computer science textbooks either in-person or online through OER, this should be able to get you at least something (that isn't OER) to fill your educational need.</p>
<h3>Amazon</h3>
<p>As a last resort, if you really aren't buying what I'm selling concerning free open source educational resources, you can buy used textbooks on Amazon. I would suggest always buying used, and buying old editions. Usually you can get the next- or second next-oldest edition of a $150 textbook for ~$25. Don't be afraid of old textbooks, it's not like the essentials of programming (which you're learning as a new student) change from year to year, and these playground bullies come out with new editions every year to churn that sweet, sweet lunch money. You can buy the 9th edition of Liang's Java textbook (mentioned above) for $9. That would provide a year's worth of programming education for the price of a lunch.</p>
<h2>III. Computers</h2>
<h3>Tablet</h3>
<p>You might be wondering the best technique to get through all these digital OER books I'm promoting. Everyone knows that reading books in paper form is preferable to reading digital copies, but if you spend a little money on a nice tablet then reading digital books can become a painless endeavor. Elsewhere, I will promote using the cheapest computer available (a Raspberry Pi) to do your research and work, but here is where I will promote splurging (if you are serious about becoming a programmer) and purchasing a nice tablet. Obviously I'm still going to promote being frugal, i.e. buying used, but there is a lot of return on investment on purchasing a nice tablet given all the reading that is required for a computer science education. The nice thing is the hardware required to read a .pdf or .epub is pretty minimal, so you certainly don't need the latest edition of a tablet computer.</p>
<p>In my opinion, you should purchase an Apple iPad. Over the past few years they have become increasingly affordable. You can now purchase a refurbished Apple iPad Air from <a href="https://backmarket.com">backmarket.com</a> for $200. A few months ago, I bought the cheapest edition of an iPad new from Amazon for $270 to replace my eight year old iPad (which still works fine for reading books (.pdf and .epubs), just the Perlego app wasn't supported since it was a 32-bit tablet instead of a 64-bit tablet). You don't want a size smaller than an iPad (avoid the iPad mini), and iPad pros are needly expensive when you can read pdfs just fine on a normal iPad. The reason I promote an iPad if you can is that the Retina display is high resolution so .pdfs looks super crisp and sharp. You can get an HD Amazon Fire tablet for $150 new and probably even cheaper used. But make sure you get a high resolution tablet if you can. There is no reason to fatigue your eyes (when reading a digital textbook is fatiguing enough already) by sacrificing for a low resolution screen. I am a total bibliophile and the only thing that has gotten me to read digital copies 99% of the time is my iPad's retina resolution. When you are reading tiny .pdf font squished onto a tiny tablet-screen, you want as high as resolution as possible.</p>
<p>The future is now and paper books are a relic of the past, especially when digital distribution of open source texts is essentially free. Paper books just can't compete with free... paper books will never be free since there is a production cost. Eat black beans, lentils, and oatmeal for three months if you have to to save up enough money to buy a HD tablet. If you are committed to keeping out of the Apple ecosystem, then find an appropriate Android tablet or Amazon HD Fire Kindle. One more detail to note is that iPad batteries last for 8+ hours, making it amazing for those days when you are reading from wake till bedtime. You want a minimum of 32gb to stock your phat OER stockpile, and to make your tablet future-proof regarding large operation system updates. But don't spend too much money buying large hard-drives, as most everything related to tablet computers these days are streaming (i.e. nothing saved locally) and digital books are only around a meg each to boot.</p>
<p>The second benefit of having a tablet is that it serves as a second monitor for watching video programming tutorials on, as detailed below. What you do is purchase a small stand that allows your tablet to be propped-up to the left of your desktop/laptop, and then you play the tutorial video on your tablet while typing and following along on your laptop.</p>
<h3>Dual Monitors</h3>
<p>Dual monitors are extremely important if you are using online education for a computer science education because it is near impossible to alt+tab back and forth between your tutorial video's code and your IDE on a single screen. You will need to have your tutorial code on the left with your IDE on the right. The Raspberry Pi finally got a second monitor jack too in 2019! With a cheap tablet, you could essentially have three monitors for your Raspberry Pi (though not needed at all, two is enough).</p>
<h3>Raspberry Pi/old desktop</h3>
<p>You can't program on a tablet, unfortunately, so you're stuck with purchasing a computer as your workhorse. Here's where you'll input all your source code, compile, and run the programs you code. Fortunately, desktop computers are cheap and ubiquitous and there's no reason to spend a lot of money on a desktop that only compiles and runs your teeny-tiny programming problem sets. I promote purchasing a <a href="http://www.raspberrypi.org">Raspberry Pi</a> for around $50 (once you include the SD card and case). Raspberry Pis run <a href="http://debian.org">Debian</a>, which is my favorite Linux distribution and the one I've been using since I was 14. I don't want to overwhelm you with the Linux stuff right now, so I'll skip the discussion other than pointing out that if you want to become a successful programmer/computer scientist you need to learn Linux in my opinion. The gift is that Linux is free and runs great on old hardware, so you can do all your programming on a $120 laptop as long as you run Debian. For example, I used my dad's seven year old laptop to complete my second year of university CS classes by running Debian on it. The limiting factor for threshold of determining if hardware is outdated is when YouTube videos run too slow to watch in a high enough definition to read the code on screen. But thanks to Linux, taking care of your desktop computing with a RPi is a gift of modernity and to indigent students, and it would be a waste of money to purchase an expensive desktop computer for your undergraduate-equivalent study when a RPi suffices. Everything you need to do as a computer science student you are able to do on a Raspberry Pi or a old Linux box. The side benefit is that knowing how to use Linux is almost a requirement of most professional programming jobs, so you can educate yourself and save money at the same time.</p>
<p>An introduction to Linux is essentially yours for $50 for the entry price of a Raspberry Pi. This is great EdTech, and I can't recommend it enough. Raspberry Pi's aren't sold in stores, though this might have changed, so if you need to purchase one with cash and don't have a credit card you can buy a "reloadable" credit card at any drug store, load it up for $75, and purchase your RPi off Amazon/AdaFruit/etc. Purchase your keyboard, mouse, SD card, and HDMI monitor used from Craigslist. Get a nice fat SD card for your disk drive, something at least 64 gb.</p>
<p>As an example of why you shouldn't pay a lot for a desktop: I purchased the cheapest Apple possible (a refurbished mini for $420) because my Apple Macbook Air that my sister bought me broke my second year of university classes but I wanted to learn Objective-C and Swift. I thought I was going to be studying computer science on my own for a little bit longer, but instead since I had applied to a nice job I found on Nature.com the month after I quit school to study Treehouse, I totally got the job and began my first development job. It furnished me with a modern Apple laptop that I carry home with me after work to study on. I haven't used my $420 Mac Mini once the whole time that I've had this job. It's dead weight. If I didn't have a tendency to hoard my old Apple computers, I would just sell it on Craigslist. Live cheap, use a Raspberry Pi, and use your job-furnished fancy laptop once you find employment to study your coding! Play a fun game in which you never buy anything fancier than the latest model of a Raspberry Pi and put the money saved into your 401k or IRA and buy index funds. You'll be amazed at the benefit to your retirement, with no sacrifice in your education. Playing video games as an adult is for chumps anyway, it's a benefit you can't play games on a Linux box. Cheap books > Expensive games. You can't get video games at a public library.</p>
<h3>Laptop</h3>
<p>The question of if you need a laptop comes down to preference. There is a lot to be gained from being able to work on your work on-the-go, at a coffeeshop, at the public library, etc. The trade off is that laptops are the most expensive computer equipment. Once you learn how to use Linux, however, you are going to be able to finish your work on a much cheaper laptop than if you didn't know how to use Linux. Debian works on a $100, ten-year old laptop. Just find the cheapest laptop possible that can still play HD YouTube videos and use that with Debian. If you use your Raspberry Pi as your main workhorse computer and just use your laptop for small work while on the go, you don't require an expensive laptop at all.</p>
<h3>No Personal Computer</h3>
<p>The hardest of hardcore, but possibly the elitist form of Holm Schooling. If your circumstances are such that you can't afford a computer at all in any form, don't fret! If you are broke, use your public library computers and internet. Everything that is required for a computer science degree can be completed at a public library terminal using a "Cloud IDE" and the library's internet. Just be prepared mentally to spend the long hours necessary to complete your work at the public library, it is your new university. Pack three meals of beans, lentils, and rice and camp out at the terminal the whole day doing your work from open to close. You are a university student. Spend the next four years there. Google "Cloud IDE" to find an IDE (Integrated Development Environment) that permits you to run your code, save your programs to your cloud account, etc for free or a couple bucks a month. Maybe use Google Drive to save your code and OER books if necessary. There will be tons of good programming books you can work through there too! Learning computer science is a good (best?) bet if you are trying to break out of the cycle of poverty. As I've mentioned before, unlike other STEM field, computer science does not require a university environment like labs. The curriculum is entirely achievable given the free resources at your public library or else open sourced on the internet. Teach yourself computer science at the public library, for example, and get yourself a first job programming somewhere, to take the small steps to help break the cycle of poverty. Watch Craigslist like a hawk for a free laptop or desktop computer. Even without internet at home, having a free offline Linux computer can be useful for night time work or offline study. Remember that, as a full-time student at your public library, you are a citizen in the communal space. Be as kind as possible and never step on any staff's toes regardless of what they do or say, especially since any perceived hostility would cut off your most valuable resource for educating yourself.</p>
<h3>Cellphone</h3>
<p>Personally I wouldn't pay for a cell phone if I couldn't afford it -- its utility is small. But if you do have a cell phone, you can use it for an on-the-go internet connection anywhere using a personal hotspot. Your data plan might prevent you from watching video tutorials, but if you have a free WiFi on a laptop from somewhere during the day, you can download your video tutorials to your laptop while there and use your cell phone as a internet connection at home for low-bandwidth browsing such as text tutorials or OER downloads. An unlimited data plan on a cell phone can sometimes be more strategic than paying for cable internet. I think that will be the most common form of internet access in the future -- it might be a little early for its time -- but if you do the research and experimentation perhaps this is a good way get semi-affordable internet. If you spend all day at the public library (or a makerspace, for example) using their WiFi, downloading the high-bandwidth stuff locally for later, then for the few hours you spend at home at night before you go to bed, if you keep it low-bandwidth, perhaps a 5G connection is enough.</p>
<p>It is very difficult to learn how to program on just a cellphone alone, hence why Raspberry Pis are still a thing in the day and age of ubiquitous cell phones, but it might serve as a suitable ebook reader if you can't afford a tablet. If you're a freak who doesn't get a headache reading .pdfs/.epub on your cell phone, or your cell phone is super large, then go for it! Be creative with the technology you can afford. Make use of everything that comes your way to the maximum it affords.</p>
<h2>IV. Education</h2>
<h3>High School - National Merit Scholarship</h3>
<p>One thing you can do to ensure that you can go to college affordably is to study your butt off for the PSAT while you are a freshman through sophomore in high school. If you have been a life long reader, and also skilled in math, now is the time to convert your precociousness into actual concrete dollars. That is to say, if you have been reading books obsessively your whole life, there is no reason not to get on top of studying for the PSAT in order to make a payoff with state schools in the form of full ride scholarships. Being a reader, you are posed to do very well on the written/reading portion of the PSAT. Some good students forgo studying for the PSAT, thinking they can just wing it and pull off being a finalist, but oftentimes even good students don't make the cut off for NM finalists (and all their lifelong effort is lost just because they didn't study for the PSAT). Don't make this mistake, and use your middle/high school years to study vocabulary so that you are all set for the PSAT. Studying vocabulary also will help your reading and writing, so you'll craft better essays and be more prepared for college. It's quite rewarding!</p>
<p>One hack I would do to study for the PSAT is download <a href="https://apps.ankiweb.net/">Anki</a>. Anki is a flash card program that is prioritized to increase learning gains by delaying frequency of showing cards that you know while increasing frequency of cards you don't know. Watch a tutorial on Anki on YouTube to get yourself acquainted. You definitely want to get yourself acquainted with Anki as soon as you can in your life. It is an asset, whether you are studying English vocab or computer science! Anki is much better than just making paper flashcards, even though that works too. Learn how to make your own set of flashcards on Anki and maintain a deck for your current studies! This is valuable knowledge that will pay off if you dedicate an hour every day to studying vocab. You can import flashcard sets for free on Anki. Just click the "Get Shared" button on the decks panel to be transported to the AnkiWeb site. You can search for "PSAT" or "SAT" to find vocabulary compendiums to import to Anki. Do this as soon as you can! The rewards will be limitless (i.e. a free college education)!</p>
<p>One thing I did in college was to cut index cards into fourth and use a hole punch to pop out a hole on the left side. I then attached the deck of flashcards on a closeable metal ring. I wrote the vocab word I didn't know on one side, then wrote a simple definition on the other side. I could pull the deck of flashcards out and flip through them whenever I had a break or was on the bus. Start doing this even in high school, whenever you read a vocab word that you don't know. Obviously you can have different decks for different source words, e.g. literature vocab, science vocab, etc. But in this day and age you can also rely on pre-made Anki decks. In fact, that's what I do nowadays for my foreign language vocab.</p>
<p>Khan Academy also offer SAT prep as a module on their web site. Be sure to study these videos years before you take the SAT, so that you are prepared for the PSAT too. Obviously Khan Academy is also a great place for studying math in general. Take studying for the PSAT as a job: You are basically competing for a full ride scholarship to a state school, which is worth ~$15k a year, so devote as much of your free time as you can towards it. If you are smart, you are only throwing away money if you don't take the time to study vocab. Don't let an unwillingness to study vocabulary words on Anki step between you and $60k! Become an expert on using Anki, and prosper as a student in high school. You'll find you earned more money than if you had been working a minimum wage job.</p>
<h3>Tuition Reimbursement from Employment</h3>
<p>One ideal is to secure yourself a job as soon as possible given the lowest amount of credentials and time invested. That's almost a tautology, but there are some benefits of jumping into the employment pool, especially if you are working as a programmer. Many jobs offer tuition reimbursement for courses taken while working. In other words, if you can get a job with an associate's degree or even no degree, then your employment sometimes will reimburse you to finish your bachelor's degree (and also your master's degree, certifications, etc.). My former job, for example, reimbursed 75% of the cost of tuition, and my current job reimburses up to $3500 a year. They do this because there are tax benefits for them, and usually you sign an agreement to work an additional year after reimbursement lest you must pay it back. That means I could get a <a href="http://www.omscs.gatech.edu/">Master's degree from Georgia Tech OMSCS</a> for free since it is well within budget. And since I don't have an undergraduate degree in CS, I supposed if I felt like it, I could get a degree from UoPeople before that too. Getting a free undergraduate and master's degree in computer science is a lush opportunity, to say the least, and that's just something programming degrees offer you as a not rich person.</p>
<p>Studying while working 40 hours a week isn't ideal, but it's otherwise possible if you take it slow. When you work in computer science you are usually studying programming anyway after work: You might as well be earning credit for it. UoPeople and Georgia Tech's OMSCS are created for people with 40 hour-a-week jobs, so as long as you take the fewest number of classes possible each semester, you will be able to dedicate enough time to your classes to get good grades and pass in however long it takes. The nice thing is that you already have a job in this setup, so you don't particularly have to rush to earn the degree. So find a job that offers tuition reimbursement ASAP in your life, and ignore getting a degree! Let your employer pay for it! Additionally, I've had jobs that pay for a free Lynda or PluralSight or Perlego account in addition to tuition reimbursement, as part of a "professional development" budget! And before that, an internship that paid for a PluralSight account for me for 6 months. Jobs are literally throwing themselves at you for educational opportunities. Don't blow it all by spending a lot on a college degree you probably don't need to get your foot in the industry's door.</p>
<h3>College</h3>
<p>If you receive a full-ride to a college, either in-state or out-of-state, be sure to take the opportunity and earn a bachelor's degree for free! If you are a National Merit Scholar with good grades, you stand a good chance of a full-ride scholarship at a in-state public school as long as you apply everywhere in your state. But with the internet, the actual educational resources offered by the university you attend are less and less exclusive to the campus and it's now a matter of self motivation and discipline for anyone interested in learning to program. You can study all the topics you need to study to learn computer science thanks to the internet! Essentially, you budget determines your actions, but I wouldn't pay more than $6k/year for a bricks and mortar four-year college. If you earn good grades in high school, there is no reason to turn down the college that offers you the cheapest tuition and inexpensive dorming. Don't worry about the prestige of the college, just go with the cheapest one with a computer science department. Online education can fill any gaps your professors leave you. All you need is a library to study at during the day and a dorm to sleep in at night. Bonus points if the college is in your hometown and you can just live and eat at home for four years to save money, which I totally recommend (put the money saved into your IRA!)</p>
<h3>Community College</h3>
<p>If your hometown has a community college, I suggest going to it for as long as you can instead of moving out of city or state and having to pay rent or for a dorm/dorm food, god forbid. You can live at home for free while you earn an associates degree in computer science. Earning an associates degree would cost about $10k total for in-state tuition. Again, don't worry about prestige and understand that you can transfer the computer science credits you earned at a community college into credits at UoPeople. If you are able to get financial aid at your hometown community college, take it! Don't spend more than $10k getting an associate's degree. Live at home. Maybe you can even find a junior developer job with just an associate, and can finish up your degree at UoPeople and OMSCS.</p>
<p>Another option to save money is to just take computer science classes (only) at your local community college (or even your local four year university). Community college is so cheap that it would be a mistake to skip them over if they offer computer science classes, especially if they transfer towards your bachelor's. That way you won't be paying for accessory classes like liberal arts classes just to earn an associates degree. By only taking computer science and math classes, you won't earn a degree, but you'll also have more time each day to dedicate to reading computer science textbooks and doing problem sets. You can dedicate some time reading classics or painting or whatever, just get the books from your public library and don't pay for them when they are ridiculously expensive (almost a Veblen good).</p>
<p>Thus, my recommendation: Take as many Math, CS, and STEM classes as you can at your local community college, living at home and studying all the extra necessary CS stuff with OER, then transfer your community college credits over to an inexpensive four year college or UoPeople if there isn't a college in your hometown when you have exhausted their CS and math catalog.</p>
<h3><a href="http://uopeople.edu">University of the People</a></h3>
<p>Allow me to geek out about the University of the People. This is a sweet program that is new and answer a lot of questions concerning how to get a job as a programmer when you are broke and can't afford college. Obviously you can study online for free through OCW and OER, but when it comes to getting your application moved forward you are going to want to have a degree in computer science from somewhere ideally. University of the People is an online college that offers such a degree for $4,800 total. I'm not going to be obtuse and say that's not a lot of money. It's basically the cost of a cheap used car. But at the moment that is the cheapest possibility for online college tuition ignoring some other factor like scholarships or financial aid. Some people criticize the name, saying no employer would take it seriously, but I think it's a totally bad-ass name (public libraries are called "universities of the people") and any employer that looks negatively on a social justice-icky-ish school names isn't one you probably want to work for anyway. Relying on social justice programs to get your through financially stressful times shouldn't be embarrassing now or ever. The simple fact is that if you study at UoPeople because you can't afford brick and mortar college, it shows that even when you couldn't afford college you wanted to study computer science at college and sacrificed to make that possible. That shows dedication, and any employer who doesn't realize that is aloof. I'm just going to be honest, most people who learn how to program as children and decide that that is a potential future career don't do it because it's a cush money maker, but they realize technology's promise to solve social problems. UoPeople is one such solution that has been created: It uses the internet and OER and open source technology to design a certified online computer science curriculum that is affordable and solved a social problem. Yes, it's not regionally accredited, so you can't transfer class credit to a brick and mortar university. So, finish the degree if you start. But it's an opportunity that only is available because of the technologies that computer science has invented. Keep the cycle of philanthropy going and learn to program in order to contribute the next new technology that solves social problems yourself. Enroll in UoPeople if you don't have a inexpensive college within driving range of your home. Supplement their courses with MOOCs, OpenCourseWare, and OER, and <a href="https://holmschool.github.io/computer-science">Holm School's curriculum</a>. Earn a F-You Degree if possible.</p>
<p>That said, UoPeople has its downsides. First, I would say that it is expensive given that it is based around OER that is freely and openly available. You can just go to <a href="http://saylor.org">Saylor.org</a> and read all the same content as in their computer science classes. Why pay money for free OER? Just for a certificate? Just read it on your own and save $4.8k if you can't afford it.</p>
<p>$4.8k is a lot of money to spend on computer science online study. I went to two years of computer science classes at a four year university in my hometown for $8k total. Granted, I didn't get a degree, but I have transferable classes if I ever feel the need to get a B.S. in CS (which I don't), and I have professors that can act as references on my resume. I could fund a <a href="http://teamtreehouse.com">Treehouse</a> account for 16 years with $4.8k, and have access to their video tutorials for so many years that I could complete the entire curriculum and learn about ~8 programming languages and a dozen more web frameworks and still have time to spare. If you live in a rural setting or all the community colleges in your hometown are too expensive, then maybe UoPeople can be justified. UoPeople operates under the assumption that people need degrees and will pay for that certification, which is an assumption proven increasingly false as the years go by and open source educational resources improve. If you resume is solid, you have a lot of good source code up on Github, you've done all your homework, and you've studied 10+ hours a day for 4 years, you're going to be able to get a job somewhere regardless of degree (at which point tuition reimbursement can pay for your degrees). If you're willing to play risky with $4.8k if you think that's enough to snag a job (and maybe you like the structure of having daily homework instead of independent, time-insensitive learning), then go for it! Otherwise buy 16 years of Treehouse/Perlego. In reality you'll need only two or three years of Treehouse/Perlego.</p>
<p>That said, you can pay for a UoPeople degree along the way working 3.5 hours a week at a minimum wage job. That seems like a sensible sacrifice to earn a B.S. degree. Honestly, a lot of good paying computer science jobs require a bachelor's degree in <em>something</em>, so $4.8k for such a certificate might just be the necessary ransom money you have to pay to ensure your job application isn't rejected a priori. UoPeople is the best option for a CS student to get a bachelor's if their hometown doesn't have affordable public college, or you can't afford it, but can afford $1.2k a year for online school.</p>
<p>One more thought. Part of what makes college interesting as an activity is its receptivity to technological advancement. Remember, if there weren't computer science departments at college, you wouldn't even have to ask whether you should go to college to study computer science. But colleges adapt to technology, so they do things like add computer science departments when they see that programming is going to play an essential part to the future. Part of that technological receptivity also is beholden to the student. If the prospective student chooses a college that doesn't embrace technology, often they are only harming themselves. A college needs to prove to the prospective student that it has a grasp on technology and a pulse to the adaptations of education as a result of new inventions and EdTech. In that sense, UoPeople should look really good to you, because it's basically futureproof. At no point in the future are people going to look at a cheap online computer science education as "a bad idea." In fact it is the most sensible response given how important programming is, and that we as a nation don't want to exclude working class kids from playing, experimenting, and inventing with computers. In that sense, UoPeople, once it gets a little more wind in its sails, is going to become a very important player in what it means to be a computer scientist in a decade or two. There is no reason not to be an early adapter, however, and partake in the benefit of getting a bachelors degree with minimum student debt. If I didn't believe that OER was just as good as paid textbooks, I wouldn't have made this site. And if I didn't believe a college degree that uses OER is just as good as a textbook-based college degree, I wouldn't have made this site. Using OER proves that UoPeople has a good grasp of technology and is able to predict the future. That sort of foresight is what you want to see in your college of choice. The fact that this foresight is found in a college that has $1k a year tuition is a godsend. I'm a big fan of public school and would promote them before any private school, but if you wind up crunching the numbers and discover public school is too expensive compared to UoPeople, as long as you don't use online classes as an excuse to slack off and still go to the public library every day to study, you should make a lot of progress in learning how to program while completely avoiding student debt. Investing in foresight is rarely a bad choice if you are studying technology.</p>
<p>I think the day and age of the student loan has passed. Student loans becoming a tradeable commodity on wall street was just one of the reasons for the crash in 2008. I think the wise decision going forth is always pay in cash your tuition and never take out a student loan. That might seem silly, but I think that's the reason UoPeople is so amazing. To fund UoPeople and four years of internet ($2000) would require 800 hours of labor at minimum wage. That means, following high school, you could work for 20 weeks (5 months) to pay for your bachelor's degree tuition and hardware expenses. This is just two more months than a summer job. I very much like this idea of paying for your tuition in cash and never taking out a (non-forgiveable) student loan. This is possible through UoPeople.</p>
<h3>Georgia Tech Online Masters of Science in Computer Science <a href="http://www.omscs.gatech.edu/">http://www.omscs.gatech.edu/</a></h3>
<p>A $7k online master's degree in Computer Science. The core specializations are Computing Systems, Machine Learning, AI, or Computational Perception/Robotics. If those aren't your areas of research interest, you might have to make some sacrifices. Computing systems is the most generic, allowing something more like a software engineering trajectory rather than operating systems or such. This is a legit program, no complaints, so work hard on acquiring the cheapest B.A. in computer science you can and then put up two years to get this master's degree for only $7k. This program is designed for working students, so your best angle of attack might be to get your B.A. in computer science through local colleges or UoPeople, then find employment, then using tuition reimbursement from your job to pay for an OMSCS degree. If I were to do that at my current job, for example, an OMSCS degree would cost $1.8k total for me. That's practically free, and honestly I'm a fool for not taking it up as soon as I got this job and wasting two years choosing to study Treehouse and Lynda instead in my spare time. Such is the life of a full stack developer! Don't make the same mistake I did, and as soon as you get a job with tuition reimbursement apply to OMSCS. Have this be a life goal.</p>
<h3>Makerspaces</h3>
<p>If your town has a makerspace, this can be a good place to study that isn't the public library. Makerspaces aren't free, but they present a good community setting that is dedicated to STEM, so it's a good alternative to the study spots that brick and mortar colleges usually provide. Test the waters by getting a makerspace subscription for a few months and spend as much time as possible there studying your classes on your laptop and meeting new people. You'll make some friends, hopefully, and then you can decide if the space is rewarding enough to continue to pay its monthly fees. Perhaps you can work out a deal because you are a student/in-need/unemployed.</p>
<h3>Tips for Being a Student</h3>
<p>Search for "study skills" in YouTube and spend as long as necessary learning how to succeed with college-level work. Programming isn't easy, and you can't skimp on the workload even if you are studying online and aren't bound by grades. If you are unemployed and have the whole day to yourself, try to study computer science for 10 hours a day, every day for 2+ years until you get a job. To fritter away valuable free time is anathema to one's goals. You should either be working and earning money, or studying in order to obtain a job to earn money. To waste your time while unemployed by not studying is playing with fire: if you can't program after four years of independent studying, what excuse will you have? Blame OER for not being good enough? Responsibility for studying each day in order to obtain a good job requires: a) never playing video games again, b) not mindlessly surfing the internet for anything more than 20 minutes a day, c) never watching tv again. Adults don't do this sort of thing anyway, and you don't want to be that drone of an adult sort that can't talk about anything other than shows on Netflix. Television and video games are for elementary school kids. Don't be a manchild and think you can succeed without work. Subscribe to PBS Passport for $60 a year instead of Netflix.</p>
<h2>IV. The Public Library</h2>
<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>Public libraries are increasingly becoming providers of online education in computer science, such as providing free access to Lynda.com and teamtreehouse.com. In my opinion, in the future you will receive a bachelor's degree for free through services provided by the public library. It is almost inevitable, mark my words. That's why I argue against spending a lot of money on a bachelor's degree because it won't be too long in the future that you will be able to receive an equivalent education for free through your public library. I can see schools like the University of the People or equivalent offering public library unlimited subscriptions for cardholders in return for a yearly sum, offering free bachelor's degrees in computer science for all library patrons. Given that  teamtreehouse.com is nearly equivalent to a computer science degree in scope (with the library offering a nonaccredited service that costs $300 a year versus UoPeople's accredited cost of $1000 a year), you could even say it is already happening, but without accreditation. Many public libraries offer cards for anyone living in the same state. For example, I can access NYPL's Lynda.com subscription even though I live in Troy, NY and will never visit the NYPL in person. If your public library doesn't offer an online service that you think it should, you can email them and request that they subscribe. Regularly check in on your library's digital resources page and take advantage of all the free services they offer. I read the New Yorker and Architectural Digest for free thanks to my public library's subscription to Flipster! That saves me like $50 a year. I can watch all the Criterion Collection movies and Teaching Company lectures thanks to the NYPL's Kanopy subscription. It's a great time to be a library patron! Public Libraries are your greatest ally as a computer science student.</p>
<h3>Treehouse <a href="http://teamtreehouse.com">http://teamtreehouse.com</a></h3>
<p>My public library in Topeka, KS offers free subscriptions (a $25/month value). These video tutorials are invaluable to someone like myself that wants to work in web development. If you are able to get a teamtreehouse subscription through a public library (if not, ask!), it is basically equivalent to getting a full ride scholarship to college. Treehouse doesn't teach computer science, more programming, so don't rely on it alone for your education or else you'll be deficient in actual computer science knowledge. But it is a great supplement to OpenCourseWare/OER. There was a point in my studies where I was learning more job-valuable skills through Treehouse than I was studying CS at university, so I unenrolled from university to study dedicatedly at Treehouse (for free, mind you). I got a job instead, rendering my super-frugal plans moot, but I am still at the point that I'm not enrolling in any more university classes (including UoPeople and Georgia Tech OMSCS) until I completely exhaust the resources available through Treehouse. It's a great service and I am grateful to my public library for being so progressive as to seeing the value of paying for it. Personally I wish Treehouse were a nonprofit but whatev.</p>
<h3>Lynda <a href="https://lynda.com">https://lynda.com</a></h3>
<p>More likely your public library will subscribe to Lynda. Lynda rocks! They have an extensive computer science section of tutorial videos. You can take many classes on most mainstream programming languages, and Lynda excels at taking you from zero experience to enough knowledge of a programming language to be able to study it at a more advanced level on your own through OER. There are more Lynda tutorials than there are hours in the day, so you'll never run out of computer science topics to learn about. My public library's dual offering of Lynda and Treehouse subscriptions keep me busy in the four hours or so I have to study after work. My job, for example, offers a free Lynda subscription to all employees! I think I have three valid Lynda subscriptions at the moment.</p>
<h3>Safari Books Online</h3>
<p>Some public libraries now subscribe to Safari Books on behalf of their patrons. This is a deal worth $200 a year. Safari has most modern programming books and gives you an entire library of up to date programming books from O'Reilly, Packt, etc. While my public library does this, if I took an hour trip to another public library in Kansas, I could get a library card that I could then use in the KC, Missouri public library to have access to their Safari subscription. I might just take the daytrip and do this. If you can hack a way to get access to Safari Books from a library nearby (I know Seattle Public Library has a subscription), do it! What a value and opportunity!</p>
<h2>V. Free Online Services</h2>
<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>These are computer science curricula that are online and require no monthly subscription fee.</p>
<h3>Khan Academy <a href="http://khanacademy.org">http://khanacademy.org</a></h3>
<p>Khan Academy can provide the equivalent of a first year of college for free. Their STEM curriculum is stupendous for being free. Combining Khan Academy with an OpenStax textbook (<a href="(http://openstax.org)">http://openstax.org</a> can provide ample learning. I think everyone attempting to earn a college-equivalent education should complete the entire oeuvre at Khan Academy. You might as well finish the entire oeuvre over at Crash Course's YouTube channel too, while you're at it. Then hit the advanced stuff and never look back.</p>
<p>Khan Academy also offers computer science topics. They are good introductions but are not going to replace OpenCourseWare. Of course the target audience for Khan Academy is high schoolers taking AP classes, so YMMV. My favorite is their class on Information Theory. If you have not watched that, drop whatever you are doing right now, sign up for a Khan Academy account, and watch the course (<a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-science/informationtheory">https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-science/informationtheory</a></p>
<h3>PluralSight <a href="http://pluralsight.com">http://pluralsight.com</a></h3>
<p>I learned about PluralSight by receiving a free subscription when I did an internship at a local company. It's a very valuable resource for programming video tutorials. It is a little more advanced than Lynda's offerings, aiming at a target audience of people that already know how to code. But they offer many beginner's courses for people that do not yet. PluralSight is usually $200/year, however PluralSight is available free through a 3 month trial period using a Microsoft account. Go to (<a href="http://signup.live.com)http://signup.live.com">http://signup.live.com)http://signup.live.com</a></a> and make an account. Then go to (<a href="https://my.visualstudio.com/)https://my.visualstudio.com/">https://my.visualstudio.com/)https://my.visualstudio.com/</a></a> and sign in with your Microsoft account you just made. At the Visual Studio Dev Essentials page choose PluralSight and click "Get Code." Go to the PluralSight page and redeem your account.</p>
<h3>FreeCodeCamp <a href="http://freecodecamp.org">http://freecodecamp.org</a></h3>
<p>This is a neat nonprofit that teaches front-end web development for free. They are trying to fulfill the need for resume material so people can get jobs, so they are very focused on certificates as you move along through their curriculum. I'm not sure they're exactly resume fodder, but if you've never done web development and you need an introduction this is a great resource. A good community too and the fact that they do it all for free is hella respectable.</p>
<h2>VI. OpenCourseWare</h2>
<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>OpenCourseWare is video of an actual college classroom lecture. Usually the syllabus of the class is available online somewhere too, so at minimum you can read along with the assigned textbook. At best you can do the same problem sets as the students. OCW is starting to show its age. It's high expense (requiring a professor, a classroom, a zoom digital camera, microphones, and so forth) prevents scaling up for distribution at low costs. But it's an interesting vantage if you are interested in seeing how college lectures are given. People are now able to create MOOCs with an iphone and a wacom bamboo tablet, so OCW might become overkill for the future. But if you are following along at home by reading the assigned textbook (always read the assigned textbook! Skipping the textbook and only watching OCW is akin to reading just the cliff notes of fine literature), you can learn a ton if the professor is good. OCW usually also covers more advanced topics, though rarely graduate level classes. Supplement your UoPeople classes with OCW found on YouTube.</p>
<h3>MIT OpenCourseWare <a href="http://ocw.mit.edu">http://ocw.mit.edu</a></h3>
<p>This started it all. A listing of OpenCourseWare that contains video is at [<a href="https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/audio-video-courses%5D((">https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/audio-video-courses]((</a><a href="https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/audio-video-courses">https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/audio-video-courses</a>)</p>
<h3>aGupieWare OCW Roundup Blog Post <a href="http://blog.agupieware.com/2014/06/online-learning-intensive-bachelors.html">http://blog.agupieware.com/2014/06/online-learning-intensive-bachelors.html</a></h3>
<p>This blog post is starting to show its age with deadlinks, but a few years ago this was the best compendium of OCW YouTube lectures on the internet. You could follow along class by class basically receiving an equivalent of a bachelor's degree. These lectures helped me so much when I was working through my computer science classes. Be sure to read whatever textbook the professor is lecturing on.</p>
<h2>VII. MOOCs</h2>
<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>Don't pay money for any of these MOOCs. They will try and entice you into paying for a certificate but please do not if you are poor. Certificates will not help you in any form. Always audit the classes. MOOC videos are not a replacement for reading the textbook on the subject. In fact I firmly believe people's time is better used reading books than it is watching MOOCs. Usually they are more like cliff's notes.</p>
<h3>Class Central MOOC Search Engine <a href="http://class-central.com">http://class-central.com</a></h3>
<p>A search engine for MOOC classes. Find what specialization you're looking to learn about.</p>
<h3>Open Source Society University <a href="https://github.com/ossu/computer-science">https://github.com/ossu/computer-science</a></h3>
<p>This is a solid compendium of MOOC classes that fulfill some semblance of a complete computer science curriculum.</p>
<h3>Coursera <a href="http://coursera.org">http://coursera.org</a></h3>
<p>For-profit MOOC platform. They have a good grasp on what's possible through a MOOC and don't usually make overly grand promises on the potential of their classes in getting you a job. They're also classy enough to offer their certification courses for free to audit and not hiding them behind a paywall.</p>
<h3>edX <a href="http://edx.org">http://edx.org</a></h3>
<p>Non-profit MOOC platform. Really good classes. Also won't hide their multi-course certification classes behind a paywall.</p>
<h3>Udacity <a href="http://udacity.com">http://udacity.com</a></h3>
<p>For-profit. Alright if you can find a class that's actually free.</p>
<h3>Stanford Lagunita <a href="https://lagunita.stanford.edu/courses">https://lagunita.stanford.edu/courses</a></h3>
<p>Stanford doesn't pair with any MOOC platform, so they just created their own platform on which to serve MOOC content. Not a wide selection, and some Stanford classes are available through OCW on YouTube, but there are some classics here like compilers and databases.</p>
<h3>Other Notable Platforms</h3>

After this and learning C with CS50, you will be able to analyze the source code of linux and begin writing open source software. This step can be done out of order and with another step. Always be reading a textbook on Linux as you are also studying programming languages.</li>
<li>Choose a text editor to get you through the programming language work. Good choices are either Microsoft Visual Studio Code (<a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">https://code.visualstudio.com/</a>) or else VI/Emacs.</li>
<li>Install Chrome on your raspbian</li>
<li>Install programming languages on your rasbian: Google &#x3C;programming language> + "install debian" to learn how to install programming languages on debian. Usually it's just an apt-get (although Java is more difficult)</li>
<li>Keep your system up to date: <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/raspbian/updating.md">https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/raspbian/updating.md</a></li>

<h3>Learn the Basics of Programming:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Buy Introduction to Java Programming by Y. Daniel Liang, ninth edition for $6 on Amazon. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/offer-listing/0132936526/ref=dp_olp_all_mbc_mma?ie=UTF8&#x26;condition=all">https://www.amazon.com/gp/offer-listing/0132936526/ref=dp_olp_all_mbc_mma?ie=UTF8&#x26;condition=all</a> Be sure you get the full edition, not the half edition (which cuts the number of chapters covered in half). This is a very good book in which it would be preferable to have the latest edition, but the latest edition is $150 whereas the $6 ninth edition covers pretty much the basics which don't really change from year to year. What you need to do is read through each and every chapter, typing in all the example code into your text editor (Visual Studio Code) and compiling using your terminal. Debug your typos. Read each chapter, then answer EVERY question at the end of each chapter. You will write a single program that does what's requested each problem. You will memorize the syntax of java by typing in a program from scratch every question, then compiling and debugging until it works. There are answers available for the odd questions available on the internet (<a href="http://www.cs.armstrong.edu/liang/intro9e/exercisesolution.html">http://www.cs.armstrong.edu/liang/intro9e/exercisesolution.html</a>) but DO NOT use them at all, unless you are absolutely stuck. If you cheat and look at the answer before attempting to answer the question yourself, you are only robbing yourself of the learning opportunity. I would rather you move on from the questions you can't answer and leave it broken than look at the answers in the zip and get into a bad habit. Read the entire book and do the questions for each and every chapter, except the graphics and GUI chapters on Swing which have been replaced with JavaFX. It is most important that you read Chapter 1 - 16 (through object oriented computing). The following chapters are on Swing/JavaFX, which is useful but Swing has been replaced by JavaFX, and after that there are chapters on Data Structures which you will want to read even if you are studying data structures somewhere else through OpenCourseWare. It will take you a long time to read the entire book if you are doing each and every problem at the end of each chapter, but by the end you'll be a confident java programmer than can create programs from scratch. Even though this step costs $6, you cannot skip it if you truly want to be a programmer. You cannot learn what you learn in this book through OpenCourseWare. You have to read the explanations of Object Oriented Programming in print, not video. This will be the wisest $15 you've ever invested. READ THE WHOLE BOOK. It will take you anywhere from 3 months to a year if you are doing each and every problem at the end of each chapter. At the conclusion of this step you can begin relying on OER for your studies, now that you know the basics of programming, which will make it much easier to learn new programming languages now that you know the fundamentals.</li>

<h2>IX. Internships</h2>
<h3>Unpaid Internship</h3>
<p>I would not do an unpaid internship.</p>
<h3>Paid Internship</h3>
<p>Try and get an paid internship as soon as you have been studying CS for 2-3 years. It will pay $10-15 an hour. I still wouldn't work more than 20 hours a week while studying.</p>
<h2>X. The humanities and other STEM classes</h2>
<p>Be sure to read for pleasure while you're studying computer science, but just don't use it to procrastinate either. Reading literature will help your writing skills. Most of the primary sources studied in humanities classes can be found at your public library. There are many humanities courses on coursera and edx too. NYPL offers Kanopy, which has The Teaching Company lectures, which cover many humanities topics. If your public library has a Lynda subscription, there are many art and illustration courses offered. Be sure to go to museums, play an instrument, study a foreign language, read books, etc. Don't think that you need a discussion group in order to learn anything about humanities. Just like CS, a lot of really good OER exists related to the humanities. The public library is invaluable for humanities studies, just google syllabi from good universities and read the assigned books if they aren't already in the public domain. Public Libraries also offer pretty good ebook services that have quality books. Overdrive makes an app called Libby that some libraries subscribe to that has a very good selection of books. And there is always Archive.org.</p>
<p>Most of what OER literacy applies to CS also applies to other STEM classes. All the resources for free CS classes also offer other STEM classes, though not as much. OpenStax is a great source for textbooks on first-year STEM. OpenCourseWare is still gold for getting lectures on STEM. Khan Academy is helpful for overviews on the subject. Honestly I would be careful combining MOOCs for CS with MOOCs for STEM. You might just burn out on MOOCs. Try and add variety somehow, whether that means reading OER instead of watching videos, etc.</p>
<h2>XI. Living Cheap</h2>
<h3>Veganism</h3>
<p>I eat five things everyday for 1500 calories. I have a $15 food scale to weigh my servings:</p>
<p>Breakfast: one 40g serving of oatmeal and 13g of flax seeds for breakfast (sweetened with splenda), 42g serving of soy protein powder</p>
<p>Lunch: 350g of cooked lentils, 42g serving of soy protein powder</p>
<p>Dinner: 300g of cooked black beans, 30g serving of split pea/rice protein powder</p>
<p>If you aren't dieting like I am, you can include extra food like brown rice, wheat bread, soy milk, tofu, wheat pasta, and peanut butter to add calories. Add vegetables as much as you can and still keep on track with your calories (I struggle to make it to the store every week to buy vegetables). I put my lunch and dinner in zip lock baggies and carry them in my backpack so I can eat them at work and head directly to the library after work to study instead of heading home. I eat this every day and supplement with vegetables/salads when I can manage to make it to the store. I obviously take vitamins every day: B12, a multivitamin, and D. It's pretty boring to eat the same thing everyday but I was $3000 under budget for food last year. The nice thing about eating this every day is that you can go to the store and buy two month's worth of food for $100-200 (bags of dried beans and lentils, cannisters of oatmeal, etc) and not worry about having to go shopping for a month. I go to the dollar store for 1.5 lbs bags of pinto beans. I cook a big batch of black beans and then lentils (two 1lb bags of black beans first, then two 1lb bags of lentils) on Sunday, and refrigerate them in tupperware to last the entire week.  I buy my soy protein powder in 40lb bags from <a href="https://www.bulksupplements.com/">https://www.bulksupplements.com/</a>. I put my day's worth of protein powder in separate ziplock bags that I reuse each day and carry them in my backpack's front pocket. It's a little awkward to make protein shakes at work but then again don't get between a vegan and their vegan protein.</p>
<p>Also never eat out at restaurants, even during the weekend (carry your beans and lentils with you, with a spoon for total on-the-go meals).</p>
<h3>Cars and Biking</h3>
<p>Always buy a used car. If you don't need a car, get a scooter. If you don't need a scooter, get an ebike. If you don't need an ebike, get a bicycle. Get a cheap bicycle off craigslist and always try to bicycle wherever you're going. It will double as exercise. Try and live within biking distance of your job.</p>

<h3>Thrift Stores for clothes</h3>
<p>It is a sensible thing to buy your clothes used from Goodwill or Salvation Army (or whatever cheap thrift stores your town might have). These are kind of bad companies, morality-wise (they're still beating that homophobia dead horse), but ultimately there is no one else offering the service that they do. I recently lost two dress sizes due to dieting and replaced my entire closet for $300 from Goodwill and Salvation Army. Each piece was a fancy brand name.</p>
<h3>Live at Home</h3>
<p>If you're just studying computer science until you get a job, you will find you have more time to study when you don't have to have a job to pay rent for a studio apartment (which you have to pay cable internet costs for, utilities, etc.). Though living at home while you're 18-22 is no treat, the money saved is worth it especially when studying computer science offers so many opportunities to land a great job and move on to the next chapter of your life. I recommend going to a college that's in your home town just so you don't have to pay for rent. If you get away from home by going to the public library or a makerspace to study each day, carrying your lunch and dinner with you, you can get away with just being at home to sleep. If you work on your lifestyle so that you're no longer drinking, there's no reason why not to live at home and save hundreds of dollars a month. Your main focus is on studying computer science.</p>
<h3>Drop alcohol and coffee and pot and diet soda</h3>
<p>These are luxury items reserved for the rich. You cannot afford them, and don't try and pretend that you can. They are highly addictive anyway, and compromise your health (mental and physical) and sleeping patterns. Never buy coffee from a shop unless you're paying for the right to study at their space (and in that case, buy decaf). Watch this lecture through Kanopy, and never touch a psychoactive again: <a href="https://www.thegreatcourses.com/courses/the-addictive-brain.html">https://www.thegreatcourses.com/courses/the-addictive-brain.html</a> I'm a vegan straightedger and it saves me thousand of dollars a year. It is also a fun challenge to remain sober and frugal each weekend and still have fun with your friends. It's also ridiculously difficult to get through a day without taking in any caffeine or wasting money on soda (I drink decaf tea every day), but when you can invest that money in retirement instead it's totally worth the struggle.</p>
<h3>Exercise</h3>
<p>Prioritize your health. You will be able to study longer and more focused if you exercise every day. Start long distance running and weight lifting. I don't have recommendations for doing this frugally, because I live in an apartment with a gym and treadmills so I don't have to worry about the cost of equipment or a gym membership. But before that I would run an hour a day outside when the weather is warm enough. You don't have to spend money on exercise clothing (see <a href="https://deadspin.com/whyd-you-dress-up-1796983974">https://deadspin.com/whyd-you-dress-up-1796983974</a> and <a href="http://gawker.com/5931205%2Fyou-dont-need-that-fancy-shit">http://gawker.com/5931205%2Fyou-dont-need-that-fancy-shit</a>). A good beginner's weight lifting program is Phrak's Greyskull LP ( <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/wiki/phraks-gslp">https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/wiki/phraks-gslp</a>). A good guide to weight lifting is <a href="https://veganliftz.com/vegan-bodybuilding/">https://veganliftz.com/vegan-bodybuilding/</a>. My one-hour-a-day schedule is: one day run an hour, the next day lift for 30 minutes then run for 30 minutes. Repeat. Long run of 2 hours/10 miles on the weekend.</p>
