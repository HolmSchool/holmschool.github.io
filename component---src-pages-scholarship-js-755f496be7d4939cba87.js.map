Having a Perlego subscription for two years would allow them (hopefully) to self-study computer science to such a degree through their repository of programming books on Perlego that they could learn enough to become a junior developer position somewhere. This would enable them to qualify for tuition-reimbursement, wherein they could earn a undergraduate degree at UoPeople and master's at OMSCS at no cost to them! We hope this scholarship will be a springboard for someone's holmschooled career!</p>\n\n      <p>For details, including the essay prompt and due date (November 11th), please visit the Github repository: <a href={`https://holmschool.github.io-educational-scholarship/blob/main/README.md`}>HolmSchool/holm-school-educational-scholarship</a></p>\n\n      <h2>Rules</h2>\n      \n      <p>This scholarship is only open to <b>Black Women/Non-Binary High School graduates in Topeka, KS!</b> Please read the <a href={`https://holmschool.github.io-educational-scholarship`}>Github repo</a> for more details.</p> */}\n\n    </div>\n    <div className=\"bigimages\">\n      <img src={birger} alt=\"Lithograph 'Utah Poplars' by Birger Sandzen\" width=\"100%\" />\n    </div>\n    \n  </Layout>\n)\n\nexport default scholarshipPage;\n\nexport const query = graphql`\n  query {\n    site {\n      siteMetadata {\n        title\n      }\n    }\n  }\n  `"],"names":["_ref","name","styles","_ref2","_ref3","_ref4","data","___EmotionJSX","Layout","Helmet","content","className","css","src","birger_2","alt","width","birger"],"sourceRoot":""}
